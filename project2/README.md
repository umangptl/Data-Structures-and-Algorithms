Requirements

This extends Assignment 1 using persistent data structures and additional similarity metrics. It requires two programs.

Loader

Create an order-32 B-tree holding word frequencies for each of at least 100 sites. Use the file system to map sites to datafiles. Use a buffer cache to speed up IO.

Pre-categorize (and somehow store) records into 5 to 10 clusters using k-means, k-mediods, or a similar metric. See course notes for details 

Application

Extend Assignment 1 to display a category (cluster) and most similar key from the above data structures.
