Requirements

1. Write a program that collects at least 500 Wikipedia pages and links from these pages to other Wikipedia pages. Collect data for similarity metrics as in Assignments 1 and 2. As a connectivity check, report the number of disjoint sets (or spanning trees from arnbitrary roots). Store persistently (possibly just in a Serialized file).

2. Write a program (either GUI or web-based) that reads the graph from step 1, allows a user to select any two pages (by title) and displays graphically the shortest (weighted by distance (inverse similarity) metric) path between them, if one exists, also indicating (or optionally constraining) whether the path passes through a mediod from assignment 2.
